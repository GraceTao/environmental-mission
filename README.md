# Learning Undefeated Environmental Mission

This web app was built with React and Vite using Material UI-styled components. All UI code is in the src folder, with the homepage in a homepage folder and each of the five tasks (four intermediate and one final task) in a tasks folder. The app was deployed using Netlify with a serverless function in the netlify/functions folder.
